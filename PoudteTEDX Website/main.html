      <strong>About TEDx, x = independently organized event:</strong>
      <p>  In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience.
           At a TEDx event, TED Talks video and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and connection.
            These local, self-organized events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event.
             The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events are self-organized. 
             (Subject to certain rules and regulations.)</p>
        <p>TED
                TED is a global foundation devoted to Ideas Worth Spreading. 
                TED was formed in 1984 as a conference that brought people together from three main walks of life: 
                Technology, Entertainment, and Design. 
                The scope of TED has expanded beyond these three areas but they remain at the core of the TEDTalks. 
                TED hosts two annual conferences, their video website TED.com, and community projects around the world. 
                TED is now a global movement focused on bringing conversations that drive meaningful change through the power of ideas.
